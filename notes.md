## Handlebars plugin

* Incompatible with *asset-pipeline*

## Handlebars-java

* Handlebars templates are not retained by *handlebars-asset-pipeline* after compilation
* Not bundled into .war file
* Could duplicate but that would defeat the point

## Nashorn

* Can load the compiled template file generated by *asset-pipeline*
* Can share the exact same helpers as in the browser
* Java 8+ only

## Angular

* Different relationship between view and code
	* in Backbone / Ember code is responsible for rendering the view
	* in Angular HTML is the source of truth and it pulls in the rendering via directives
* not amenable to server-side rendering
* can use a PhantomJS proxy but it's more difficult than it seems
* best solution is to "pre-seed" data as a JSON block in the page
	* this avoids additional HTTP request(s) to retrieve data
	* really easy to do this with Angular as you can seed the $http cache

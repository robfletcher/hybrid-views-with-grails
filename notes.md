## Handlebars plugin

* Incompatible with *asset-pipeline*

## Handlebars-java

* Handlebars templates are not retained by *handlebars-asset-pipeline* after compilation
* Not bundled into .war file
* Could duplicate but that would defeat the point

## Nashorn

* Can load the compiled template file generated by *asset-pipeline*
* Can share the exact same helpers as in the browser
